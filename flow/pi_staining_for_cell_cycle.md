# PI Staining for Cell Cycle

#### <u>Purpose</u>: To determine cell cycle status by staining for DNA content

#### <u>Materials needed</u>:

| Propidium Iodide (PI) |  |  |
| TritonX-100 |  |  |
| RNase A |  |  |

#### <u>Protocol</u>:

##### Fixation

1. Harvest cells and spin down. Resuspend in **500ul** of cold PBS. 
	- *Prior to collecting the cells, it is usually worthwhile to also collect the media from the well and pooling this together with the cells. The media can contain apoptotic cells you can detect as the 'sub-G1' population.*

2. While gently vortexing (setting of 2 or 3 on the Vortex-Genie), add dropwise **2ml** of cold 100% ethanol.

3. Allow cells to fix @ 4&deg;C or **-20&deg;C** for at least 2 hrs. If storing cells for staining later, place cells directly at  **-20&deg;C** (cells can be stored for several weeks).  For best results, allow fixation for at least 12-24hrs.


##### Staining

1. Spin cells @ 2000rpm x 5min (all subsequent centrifugation steps should also be performed at **2000rpm**).

2. Wash 2x with 3ml of PBS each time. Transfer to 5ml FACS tubes after the first wash.

3. Resuspend cells in **100 - 200ul** of PI/TritonX-100 staining solution:
	- **PBS w/ 0.1% TritonX-100**    (1:100 dilution of 10% stock)
	- **0.2mg/ml RNase A**    (1:50 dilution of 10mg/ml stock)
	- **20ug/ml PI**         (1:50 dilution of 1mg/ml stock)

4. Stain for 30min @ room temp in the **dark**.

5. Add 100-300ul PBS. 

6. Run on flow cytometer. Alternatively, stained cells can be stored @ 4&deg;C protected from light for a few days.
