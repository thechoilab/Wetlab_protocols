**Lentiviral Production and Transduction Protocol**

(Calcium phosphate transfection method)

By: Peter Choi

**Transfection procedure:**

1) Seed 293T cells @ 600-800K per well of 6-well with 3ml DMEM/10% FBS/**no antibiotics**, 

​                 or 2.5-3 x 106 cells per 10cm plate with 10ml DMEM/10% FBS/**no antibiotics**.

  Ideally, want cells to be 50-70% confluent for transfection the next day. 

 

2) Immediately before transfecting, add chloroquine to cells at 25uM final concentration.

 

4) Prepare transfection solution as follows (for lentiviral production):

|                               | **For 6-well (1-well)** | **For 10cm plate**    |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| **2M  CaCl2**                 | 18.75  ul               | 62.5  ul              |
| **Sterile  water**            | to  131.25 ul with DNA  | to  437.5 ul with DNA |
| **DNA  #1: Transfer vector**  | 1 ug                    | 4 ug                  |
| **#2: psPAX2 (or pCMVdr8.9)** | 1ug                     | 4 ug                  |
| **#3: pMD2.G (or pVSV.G)**    | 0.1ug                   | 0.4  ug               |
| **Total so far**              | 150ul                   | 500 ul                |
|                               | +                       | +                     |
| **2X  HBS\***                 | 150  ul                 | 500  ul               |
| **TOTAL**                     | 300 ul                  | 1000 ul               |

 *Mix well while adding 2X HBS (can also add dropwise while vortexing, but not necessary)

5) Let mixture stand for 1-5 minutes and add to cells. Mix gently by moving plate side-to-side. Transfer cells to virus room incubator.

6) 12-24hrs after transfecting, change to complete DMEM **with antibiotics** (or without antibiotics for slightly higher titer), or alternatively, change to growth media of target cells. Collect virus every 24hrs  (virus can be stored at 4C for several days, and multiple collections can be pooled before infecting target cells). Consult TRC protocol for details (http://www.broadinstitute.org/rnai/public/resources/protocols).

 

**Lentiviral transduction:**

*For adherent cells, It is best to seed the target cells one day prior to transduction. But this is not absolutely necessary.

1)   Prepare target cells and seed in a 6-well or 12-well plate at the appropriate density in regular growth medium, supplemented with **polybrene at 8ug/ml** final concentration. Polybrene 

2)   Add virus and mix by pipetting. Exact volume will depend on target cell infectivity, titer of virus, and desired MOI.

3)   For adherent cells, can directly incubate overnight at 37C. For higher infection efficiency (or for transducing suspension cells), spin plates at 1000xg for 30-90 minutes at 30C. After spin, incubate overnight at 37C.

4)   Following day, change to fresh growth media. Can begin selection 24-48 hours after transduction. For low-titer infections, it is preferable to wait 48 hours before beginning selection. 

5)   Continue selecting, change to fresh media with selection drug every 2-3 days. Split or expand cells as necessary.
