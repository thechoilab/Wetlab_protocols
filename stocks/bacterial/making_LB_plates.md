#### <u>Protocol</u>:

Each 100 mm diameter petri dish can hold about 10-15 mL of LB agar. So to pour a stack of 20 petri dishes, you will need approximately 300 mL of LB agar solution. To pour about 4-5 sleeves, make up 1500 mL of LB agar solution.

1. Prepare an erlenmeyer flask with the following:
| Ingredient | Amt per Liter | Amt for ~1 sleeve (20 plates) | Amt for ~4-5 sleeves (80-100 plates) |
| ---- | ---- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **LB powder\* (Lennox)** | 21.6 g | 12.96 g | 32.4 g |
| **Bacto agar powder** | 17 g | 10.2 g | 25.5 g |
| **Water** | 1000 mL | 300 mL | 1500 mL |
*\*This amount can vary depending on the manufacturer.*


2. Add a magnetic stir bar (to stir later while cooling after autoclaving).

3. Cover the mouth of the flask with foil and secure with autoclave tape.

4. Autoclave flask on **'liquid' cycle for 15-30 min**.

5. After autoclaving, place flask on a stir plate and **stir <u>slowly</u>** while solution cools. If you stir too fast, it will introduce small bubbles that will appear on the plate when it is warmed up again and make it hard to distinguish colonies.

6. When solution is sufficiently cooled (when flask is warm, not hot, to the touch, approximately 60&deg;C), add antibiotic to desired 1X concentration and stir slowly for an additional 1-2min.

8. Pour just enough solution to cover the bottom of the dish (~15 mL/plate). Alternatively, you can use a sterile serological pipette but pouring is faster.
	- Mark sides of petri dishes with a colored marker to indicate antibiotic added
	- Stack plates after pouring to prevent condensation from forming on lids
	
8. Let plates cool on bench for several hours up to overnight. Leaving them overnight helps to let most of the condensation evaporate.

9. Store plates lid-side down in plastic sleeve bag, secure with tape labeled with antibiotic and store at 4&deg;C.

10. Thoroughly rinse out flask, making sure no solid agar bits are still left and leave for glassware washing.
