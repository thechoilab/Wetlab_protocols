###Protocol for making up antibiotic stocks
---
#### Recommended concentrations:

| Antibiotic | Solvent | Stock Concentration | Working Concentration | Storage temp. of powder|
| ---------- | ------- | ------------------- | --------------------- | ---------|
| Ampicillin | water | 100 mg/mL | 100 µg/mL | 4&deg;C |
| **Carbenicillin**\* | water | 100 mg/mL | 100 µg/mL | -20&deg;C |
| **Chloramphenicol**  | EtOH | 25 mg/mL | 25 µg/mL | room temp. |
| Hygromycin B | water | 200 mg/mL | 200 µg/mL | 4&deg;C |
| **Kanamycin** | water | 50 mg/mL | 50 µg/mL | 4&deg;C |
| **Spectinomycin** | water | 50 mg/mL | 50 µg/mL | 4&deg;C |
| Tetracycline | water | 10 mg/mL | 10 µg/mL | -20&deg;C |

The main antibiotics we use in lab are **in bold**.

\*Carbenicillin can be used at 50µg/mL in solid media and at 100µg/mL in liquid media

#### Protocol for preparing antibiotic solutions:

1. Weigh out the desired amount of antibiotic powder and dissolve it in the appropriate volume of solvent (most antibiotics will dissolve quickly).
	* Usually, we make up about 10 mL of stock solution
2. Sterilize solution by filtering through a **0.2 µm syringe filter** (do in the tissue culture hood to maintain sterility). Skip this step if antibiotic is dissolved in ethanol (ie. Chloramphenicol).
3. Aliquot into sterile 1.5 mL eppendorf tubes (inside tissue culture hood).
4. Label tubes with:
	* Name of antibiotic (can use abbreviation)
	* Date solution was made
	* Concentration of stock solution
5. Store aliquots at **-20&deg;C**.
6. To use, dilute the antibiotic in LB media at 1:1,000. For example, add 100 µL of stock antibiotic to 100 mL of LB media. \*For Carbenicillin, recommended to dilute stock 1:500 instead for liquid LB media.
