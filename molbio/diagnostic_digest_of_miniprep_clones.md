# Protocol for diagnostic digest of miniprep clones

#### <u>Purpose</u>:
To screen miniprep DNA by restriction digest to identify correct clones.

---
#### <u>Protocol</u>:

1. Set up the digest as follows:

| Ingredient | Amount for 1 digest | Master Mix |
| ---- | ------- | -------- |
| **10X Restriction Enzyme Buffer (ie. Cutsmart or FastDigest)** | 1 &mu;L |  |
| **Restriction enzyme** | 0.1 &mu;L (1-2 units) |  |
| **DNA** | 200-500 ng | |
| **Water** | to 10 &mu;L total | |


2. Incubate at 37&deg;C for 30 minutes.
3. Add 2 &mu;L of 6X DNA Loading Dye (or equivalent) and run on an agarose gel.

---
**Notes:**
* Incubations can be reduced in length to 5-10 min, but digests will be more complete if allowed to incubate longer.
* Interestingly, restriction digests can also be done rapidly by short exposure to microwaves (see [this patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US5350686A/en) and other references around the internet...).
