# General cloning workflow

#### <u>Purpose</u>:
To prepare necessary DNA fragments for cloning purposes

#### <u>Materials needed</u>:

#### <u>Protocol</u>:

**Important notes:**

#### Vector backbone preparation:
1. 

#### Insert preparation:
*If by digest, see "Vector digest for general cloning"*

*If by PCR amplification, see below:*

1. Prepare a PCR reaction as follows:


2. Run entire volume of PCR reaction (w/appropriate amount of loading dye) in a 1% TAE agarose gel.
		*TAE is preferred over TBE*

3. Visualize on a gel imager (*preferably using blue light*) and take a picture for your records. Extract the PCR product of the expected size (if present) and purify using a gel purification kit. It is recommended to elute in 10-15 ul to maximize recovery while maintaining a reasonable DNA concentration.

4. *Optional* Proceed with further preparation of insert if necessary (ie. digestion to generate sticky ends -- see protocol for "Digestion of PCR products").

#### Assembly:

1. Once all DNA fragments have been purified and prepared, continue with assembly using appropriate method (see corresponding protocol):
		- T4/T7 DNA ligation
		- Gibson/Isothermal Assembly
		- Golden Gate Assembly
