# Gateway LR cloning

#### <u>Purpose</u>:
To transfer an insert from an Entry vector into a Destination vector.

#### <u>Materials needed</u>:
| Item | Company | Cat. No. |
| ---- | ------- | -------- |
| LR Clonase II Enzyme Mix | Thermo Scientific | 11791020 |
| Proteinase K | Thermo Scientific | (included with LR Clonase II) |
| Competent cells (ie. Stbl3) | n/a | n/a |

---
#### <u>Protocol</u>:

**Important notes:**
*Amounts are halved from manufacturer's protocol. Works fine.*

1. Assemble the following components for each desired reaction:
| Component | Amount |
|-----------| -------|
| Entry vector (ie. pDONR223 w/insert) | ~75 ng |
| Destination vector | ~75 ng |
| Water (or TE pH 8.0) | to 4 &mu;L |

2. Thaw on ice the LR Clonase™ II enzyme mix for about 2 minutes. Vortex briefly twice (2 seconds each time) and spin down briefly.
3. To each reaction, add **1 μL of LR Clonase™ II enzyme mix** to the reaction. Vortex briefly twice and spin down briefly.
4. Return LR Clonase™ II enzyme mix to –20°C or –80°C storage.
5. Incubate reactions at **room temperature for 30-60 minutes**.
6. Add **1 μL of the Proteinase K solution** to each sample to terminate the reaction. Vortex briefly. Incubate samples at **37°C for 10 minutes**.
7. Transform 1ul of reaction into 50ul of **Stbl3** competent bacteria.

8. Spread entire transformation on plates with appropriate antibiotic (typically carbenicillin).

**Other notes:**
*Taken from manufacturer's manual*

- For LR recombination reactions, the most efficient substrates are supercoiled attL-containing entry vectors and supercoiled attR-containing destination vectors. For large (>10 kb) entry clones or destination vectors, linearizing the entry clone or destination vector may increase the efficiency by up to 2-fold.
- To increase the number of colonies containing the desired expression clone, increase the incubation time from the recommended 1 hour to 2 hours-overnight. Longer incubations are recommended for plasmids $\ge$10 kb to increase the yield of colonies.
-  We recommend using 50–150 ng entry clone per 10 μL reaction. Highest colony yields are typically obtained using 150 ng entry clone and 150 ng destination vector. Do not use >150 ng entry clone as you may obtain colonies containing multiple DNA molecules (often with an associated “small colony” phenotype). Using <50 ng entry clone will generate fewer colonies.
