#### <u>Protocol</u>:

To grow up more of any plasmid, you can just re-transform bacteria. For best results, transform and plate before picking a colony for liquid culture.

1. Transform 10 ul of competent cells with ~0.5 ul of plasmid (only need a small amount). If the selection marker is amp, then you can do a quick transformation. Otherwise, include a 1 hour recovery step.

2. Plate ~2-3 ul of transformation onto LB agar plates with the appropriate antibiotic. Because of the tiny volume, it is recommended to use a physical spreader (ie. T-shaped spreader) rather than beads.

3. Incubate overnight at the appropriate temperature (30 or 37 C).

4. The next day, pick a colony for liquid culture.
